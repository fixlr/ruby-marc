marc is a ruby library for reading and writing MAchine Readable Cataloging
(MARC). More information about MARC can be found at <http://www.loc.gov/marc>.

Here's some typical usage:

    require 'marc'

    # reading records from a batch file
    reader = MARC::Reader.new('marc.dat')
    for record in reader
        # print out field 245 subfield a
        puts record['245']['a']
    end

    # creating a record 
    record = MARC::Record.new()
    record.add_field(MARC::Field.new('100', '0',  ' ', ['a', 'John Doe']))

    # writing a record
    writer = MARC::Writer.new('marc.dat')
    writer.write(record)
    writer.close()
